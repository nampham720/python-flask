# python-flask

This is the implementation (in progress) of my thesis based on the *thesis sketchup*. 

The idea is to build a website (log-in required), receiving text from users then perform checking similarity. 

**Knowledge**: python, HTML, mySQL, jinja template.

Additional tool: boostrap, ckeditor.
