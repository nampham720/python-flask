# python-flask

This is the implementation (in progress) of my thesis based on the *thesis sketchup*. 

The idea is to build a website (log-in required), receiving text from users then perform checking similarity. 

The finished product is being built. So far, user can only:
* Log in. 
	* Once logged in, the "Article" section will appear. This is where your articles will be stored on the database.
* Edit/Delete the article

**Function missing**: Checking similarity

**Knowledge**: python, HTML, mySQL, jinja template.

Additional tool: boostrap, ckeditor.
